# PID-controller-simulator
This can be considered a homework for students who want to learn to implement a Proportional Derivative Integral (PID) Controller so I will not provide a solution just yet. This program is a simulation of the physics of a drone ascending. The drone has mass, it's in a gravitational field and has to reach a certain height. The drone is equipped with motors that do not have an instant response to simulate motors in the real world. The student has to write a PID Controller in the "pid.cpp" file and when he runs the program, the drone has to reach the target height as fast as possible with a minimal overshoot.
